            "text": "Frequently Asked Questions about the Open Science Grid\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\n\nWhat is the Open Science Grid (OSG)?\n\n\nThe Open Science Grid brings together a distributed, peta-scale computing and storage resources into a uniform shared cyberinfrastructure for large-scale scientific research. It is built and operated by a consortium of universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers. \nRead more...\n\n\nWho funds the OSG?\n\n\nThe OSG is supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. Funding for work done at sites and by partners comes from a variety of sources specific to that site or organization.    \n\n\nDoes OSG control the OSG resources?\n\n\nNo, individual resource owners do.\n\n\nWhat services are available in the OSG?\n\n\nJob submission, data transfer and storage, authentication, accounting, monitoring, central information gathering/publishing, web caching (proxy), and more. \nRead more...\n   \n\n\nWho participates in the OSG?\n\n\nThe Open Science Grid is a collaboration of science researchers, software developers and computing, storage and network providers who come from universities, national laboratories and computing centers. Although based primarily in the United States, the OSG includes participants in other nations. \nRead more...\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nWhere can I get funding to convert my applications to parallelism needed on the OSG?\n\n\nThe OSG can provide assistance with \ninstallation and administration of OSG sites\n, installation and use of \nclient software\n to run grid jobs on the OSG, and \nUser Help\n in enabling your application for the grid. But the OSG does not provide funding for this process.   \n\n\nWhat application requirements are \nNOT\n well-suited to the OSG?\n \n\n\nApplications that require:\n\n\n\n\nInput from the user during execution. However, applications of this kind can often be rewritten so as to not require the interaction, or to decrease it to levels where the grid's resources can provide substantial runtime improvements.\n\n\nA large ammount of inter-process communication between jobs (for example, needing MPI); very few sites are currently MPI-enabled.\n\n\nStrict schedules and dependencies on external data sources.\n\n\nExcessive bandwidth between sites.\n\n\nFirm and nonstandard system dependencies.\n\n\nInter-process communication on the grid servers, including complex job flows network ports or protocols that are not disallowed at the grid site. For the most part it is preferable to pre-stage the data at the site rather than pull in large datasets. \n\n\n\n\n(Adapted from Ferreira, et al (2004), [Grid Services Programming and Application Enablement(http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246100.html?Open)  pp. 76.)\n\n\nHow do I use the OSG resources?\n\n\nTo get started using the OSG infrastructure, you must:\n    1. Join a \nVirtual Organization\n registered with OSG\n    2. Download and install the OSG client software, or the customized version for your Virtual Organization\n    3. Enable your appllication for grid computing\n    4. Submit your job to a resource available to your Virtual Organization\n\n\nRead more...\n   \n\n\nWhere can I get training on how to use the grid?\n\n\nThe \nEducation, Training and Outreach activity\n offers grid schools and workshops in a variety of locations across the US and abroad. Your group can sponsor a grid school at your facility. The grid school tutorial labs are available online and can be done by individuals on their own, requiring only access to an OSG compute element.   \n\n\nHow do I port my existing application to work on the OSG resources?\n\n\nSee links under in \nUser Resources\n and \nPorting Your Application\n. \n\n\nIs there a glossary of grid computing terms?\n\n\nYes, see the \nglossary of OSG terms\n.   \n\n\nHow do I get permission to edit information on the Page?\n\n\n\n\nFork the repository from GitHub\n\n\nSubmit a pull request to the repository after making changes\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Organizations (VO)\n\n\nWhat is an OSG Virtual Organization (VO)?\n\n A Virtual Organization (VO) is collection of persons. Members of a VO may come from many different home institutions in geographically separate places, may have in common only a general interest or goal (e.g., CMS physics analysis), and may communicate and coordinate their work solely through information technology (hence the term virtual). \nRead more...\n    \n\n\nDo I have to be part of a VO in order to use or contribute to OSG?\n\n\nYes. Learn more about VOs from \nthe Virtual Organizations page\n.   \n\n\nWhere do I find which VOs are already registered with OSG?\n\n\nSee the \ncurrent VO list\n.   \n\n\nIf I'm not part of a registered VO and my research group can't support a VO, what are my options?\n\n\nYou may join the VO named (confusingly) \"OSG\".\n\n\nHow do I join an OSG Virtual Organization (VO)?\n \n\n\nDifferent VOs may have different membership requirements and procedures. You will first need to determine which VO is most appropriate for you to join, then either see that VOs web pages or go to the \nVO List\n for links to that VO's membership procedures. \nRead more...\n   \n\n\nSo many acronyms start with \"VO\"; how do I keep them straight?\n\n\nRead \nVO\n.   \n\n\nHow does a VO fit into the OSG?\n\n\nRead \nHow does a VO fit into the OSG?\n.    \n\n\nHow do I form a new VO?\n\n\nContact User Support\n if you want to form a new VO.   \n\n\nGetting Support\n\n\nHow do I get support for problems I encounter while using OSG resources?\n\n\nUsers typically get support through contacting your \nVO's support center\n. Site administrators often use the \nosg-general\n and \nosg-int\n mailing lists. \nRead more about getting user help and support...\n    \n\n\nWhat is the Grid Operations Center (GOC)?\n \n\n\nSee \nWhat is the Grid Operations Center (GOC)?\n or go directly to \nGrid Operations Center\n.   \n\n\nWhat OSG mailing lists should I subscribe to?\n\n\nThe OSG's mailing lists are categorized and described on the \nmailing lists\n page. Some are used to distribute announcements, others to provide discussion forums, activity coordination forums, and so on. We suggest that everyone subscribe to \nOSG\n, \nOSGNEWS\n, and \nOSG-GENERAL\n (all \n@opensciencegrid.org\n). Further subscriptions should be based on the types of activities you become involved in.   \n\n\nRunning Jobs\n\n\nHow do I run a job on an OSG resource?\n \n\n\nThis is often specific to your particular VO's policies and procedures. However we provide some links under the heading \"End Users (Researchers, application users)\" on the \nDocumentation hub\n with some OSG-generic information.    \n\n\nHow can I monitor my OSG work?\n \n\n\nThere are multiple monitoring infrastuctures to provide targeted views of the distributed facility. You can receive periodic reports by subscribing to the \nosg-ops-status\n email list (\n@opensciencegrid.org\n). Read more information in \nGRACC Grid Accounting\n.    \n\n\nHow do I troubleshoot a job that is not running properly?\n\n\nOSG has a \nTroubleshooting Guide\n or you can contact \nUser Help\n.    \n\n\nCan I really run my job on any OSG resource without talking to the site first?\n\n\nAlmost. You can run your job on any OSG site that allows users from your Virtual Organization. Many sites allow users from all OSG VOs. The VOs allowed to run on each resource can be found in the \n2F08\n2F2012\nend_type=now\nend_date=02\n2F08\n2F2012\nfacility=on\nfacility_10009=on\ngridtype=on\ngridtype_1=on\nactive_value=1\ndisable_value=1\">OSG Resource List\n    \n\n\nWhat is the difference between gram2 and gram4 (i.e., between globus-job-run and globusrun-ws)?\n \n\n\nAccording to \nGlobus\n\n\n\n\n\"In WS GRAM, the globusrun-ws command implements the functionality of globusrun using the XML Job Description language in place of the RSL format job description of pre-WS GRAM. It also allows specifying parts of the Job Description with simple command line arguments (for executable and arguments), similar to what one would do with globus-job-run. Like globusrun, the globusrun-ws program supports both the interactive and batch submission of GRAM jobs.\"\n\nRead more...\n    \n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I run a \"bazillion squillion\" jobs on one site?\n\n\nPlease don't. If you do, you'll only do it once. Remember the sites control their resources, OSG doesn't. If you make the site administrators angry, their retribution may be visited upon you specifically, or on your entire VO. Then you've got a lot of angry people to deal with. See \nHelpful Hints for Running At-Scale on the OSG\n.\n\n\nAbout OSG's Software\n\n\nWhat is the VDT?\n\n\nThe VDT is the underlying software distribution used by OSG sites and user to provide and access computing and storage across OSG. It attempts to be grid-agnostic and can be used by multiple grids. \nRead more...\n\n\nWhat is the OSG Software Stack? How is it related to the VDT?\n\n\nThe OSG Software Stack is the subset of the VDT used by OSG sites. It also includes OSG-specific configuration such as hostnames of services running in OSG.\n\n\nWhat is Pacman?\n\n\nPacman\n is the package management tool that was used to install most of the OSG software stack prior to Release3. We now use yum and RPMs. See \nyum and RPM basics\n.\n\n\nWhy do you use Pacman instead of RPM?\n\n\nPacman provides some really nice features, such as the ability to install multiple versions at the same time and the ability to install software as non-root. That said, as of the writing of this answer (February 2010), we are working hard on providing the VDT as native packages, both RPM and Debian.   \n\n\nHow is the OSG software validated before moving a new release to production?\n\n\nAll OSG software undergoes three levels of testing before releasing it to production. First, the VDT team tests software internally. Second, a small group of sites called the Validation Testbed (or VTB) tests the software. Finally, a larger group of cooperative sites called the Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed (or ITB) do testing along with VOs, who ensure their software continues to work correctly. Only once the ITB has given its stamp of approval can we release the software for production use.\n\n\nInstallation and Configuration of OSG Sites\n\n\nWhat do I have to have in place before I setup an OSG resource?\n\n\nSee \nSite Planning\n.    \n\n\nHow do I make my site's resources available to OSG members?\n\n\nOSG welcomes new resources! The basic installation of an OSG Compute Element or Storage Element requires that certain sets of hardware be available and configured with the OSG software. You will also need to determine your site's policies for usage. It is best to contact us (see \ncontacts\n or you can dive into the \ndocumentation\n.    \n\n\nWhat should I name my OSG resource?\n\n\nEach OSG resource needs a unique name by which services and resources may refer to the resource. This name will be displayed on the Site Catalog and used in tables for other monitoring and accounting. See \nResource Name\n.\n\n\nHow do I install an OSG compute element?\n\n\nThe OSG Computer Element (CE) software has several prerequisites for the platform and hardware. You will also need to understand the systems that you will be using for your CE and worker nodes, along with the network and firewall configuration for your site. Start with \nPreparing Compute Element.\n    \n\n\nWhat should I install on my site's worker nodes?\n\n\nThere are a few options. See \nWorker Node Client\n.   \n\n\nDo I need to shut down and uninstall my Compute Element (CE) installations before I upgrade them?\n\n\nYou need to shutdown all services. See \nStopping Services\n. (Also, see the man page: \nman vdt-control\n.)    \n\n\nHow should I configure local storage on my OSG compute element?\n\n\nSee \nLocal storage configuration\n. How do I set up a BestMan based Storage Element? Please refer to the instructions on \nBestman\n.\n\n\nAdministration of OSG Sites\n\n\nHow do I troubleshoot the edg-mkgridmap script?\n\n\nSee the \nEdg Mkgridmap Troubleshooting Guide\n    \n\n\nHow do I activate and deactivate my Resource on the OSG?\n\n\nSee the \nHow to register your resource with GOC\n.    \n\n\nHow do I authorize users on a compute element?\n\n\nOSG supports three of the available GUMS authorization scenarios: Grid3/Local, Compatibility, and Full Privilege. All three use the Virtual Organization Membership Service (VOMS). \nRead more...\n    \n\n\nSecurity and Certificates\n\n\nWhat should I do if a security incident occurs?\n\n\nIf you believe a security incident has occurred with an OSG resource, please go to \nIncident Discovery and Reporting\n, and report it \nimmediately\n.        \n\n\nAfter a security incident, how do I (as a resource admin) ban a suspicious user?\n \n\n\nCurrently, OSG software stack does not provide any banning tool. The security team is working to provide a banning tool this year. However, there are a few effective alternatives.\n\n\nFirst, if the suspicious user's certificate is revoked (this quite often happens in incidents), make sure that you have updated CRL lists from that CA. You can manually download the CRLs or run fetch-crl script provided by VDT. This is already installed in your VDT stack and typically under your installation directory. Once downloaded the CRLs will most likely be located in /etc/grid-security/certificates. This will ensure that at the authentication step, the suspicious user would fail and cannot access your grid resources. Of course, you have to ensure that your applications and resources/services also consult the CRLs during the authentication step.\n\n\nIf the certificate is not revoked, you can remove the mapping for this user in your GUMS (see GUMS web page \nhttps://www.racf.bnl.gov/Facility/GUMS/1.2/use_configuration.html\n). Once the user's mapping is removed, the user's authorization with your site would fail. However, be careful that every 8 hours or so, your GUMS server synchronizes with VOMS servers. Therefore if the suspicious user is still listed as a member of a VO, your GUMS server would fetch the membership and create a mapping for this user. You can either remove the user's mapping every 8 hours from GUMS or create a special \"null\" mapping for the user in your GUMS. This null mapping should not be overwritten by the synchronization data.\n\n\nWhat is a grid certificate?\n\n\nGrid certificates are ways to prove that you are who you claim to be when you attempt to use an OSG resource. These certificates are issued by a trusted source (e.g., the US Dept. of Energy) and require a password from you. In this way, they are similar to using ID cards such as your driver's license or passport. You must have a currently valid certificate that was issued from an approved Certificate Authority to use OSG resources. \nRead more...\n    \n\n\nHow do I get or renew a grid certificate for users of the OSG?\n\n\nThere is \nHow do I get a certificate for the OSG\n. Contact your Virtual Organization for what certificate authority is used within your group. To renew an unexpired certificate or replace an expired certificate, see \nmiscellaneous certificate tasks\n.    \n\n\nCan someone reset the password on my certificate key?\n\n\nNo. You are the only person who knows the password to your keys.   \n\n\nWhat are OSG users' responsibilities in keeping OSG resources secure?\n\n\nAs an OSG user, you are expected to:\n    * Protect your grid identity token\n    * Abide by the policies and procedures of your Virtual Organization (VO)\n    * Report any known or suspected security breach\n\nRead more...\n    \n\n\nWhat are OSG resource administrators' and VO administrators' responsibilities in keeping OSG secure?\n \n\n\nAs an admin, you are expected to:\n    * Protect all grid identity tokens (personal, host, service)\n    * Follow the \ninstructions for installing and configuring OSG software\n\n    * Abide by the policies and procedures of your Virtual Organization (VO)\n    * Report any known or suspected security breach\n\nRead more...\n    \n\n\nWhat do I do if my root certificate expires?\n\n\nYou can fetch the new certificate, if available and import it into your trusted root CA directories. Please make sure that that you download the Digicert root and intermediate CA certs that are needed to add to the OS X Keychain (for example) or to the trusted issuer stores in the various browsers from \nhere\n. See \nInstall CA certificates in the browser\n for the entire procedure.\n\n\nIf there is no new certificate, then you can remove the expired certificate from trusted CA directory. Since the CA is no longer serving, you do not trust the certificates issued by this CA.\n\n\nHow do I update my GUMS service template?\n\n\nThis is discussed in \nInstalling and Configuring GUMS\n. You will use the \ngums-create-config\n script.    \n\n\nHow do I update my CA trusted directories?\n\n\nThere is a package to automatically update the trusted CA certificates begining with VDT 1.8 (OSG 0.8). See http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html#vdt-update-certs\n\n\nMy web browser does not trust the OSG CA?\n\n\nSee \nInstall CA certificates in the browser\n for a procedure to solve this problem.",

For the most part it is preferable to pre-stage the data at the site rather than pull in large datasets.    (Adapted from Ferreira, et al (2004), [Grid Services Programming and Application Enablement(http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246100.html?Open)  pp. 76.)  How do I use the OSG resources?  To get started using the OSG infrastructure, you must:\n    1. Join a  Virtual Organization  registered with OSG\n    2. Download and install the OSG client software, or the customized version for your Virtual Organization\n    3. Enable your appllication for grid computing\n    4. Submit your job to a resource available to your Virtual Organization  Read more...      Where can I get training on how to use the grid?  The  Education, Training and Outreach activity  offers grid schools and workshops in a variety of locations across the US and abroad. Your group can sponsor a grid school at your facility. The grid school tutorial labs are available online and can be done by individuals on their own, requiring only access to an OSG compute element.     How do I port my existing application to work on the OSG resources?  See links under in  User Resources  and  Porting Your Application .   Is there a glossary of grid computing terms?  Yes, see the  glossary of OSG terms .     How do I get permission to edit information on the Page?   Fork the repository from GitHub  Submit a pull request to the repository after making changes",

According to  Globus   \"In WS GRAM, the globusrun-ws command implements the functionality of globusrun using the XML Job Description language in place of the RSL format job description of pre-WS GRAM. It also allows specifying parts of the Job Description with simple command line arguments (for executable and arguments), similar to what one would do with globus-job-run. Like globusrun, the globusrun-ws program supports both the interactive and batch submission of GRAM jobs.\" Read more...        What happens if I run a \"bazillion squillion\" jobs on one site?  Please don't. If you do, you'll only do it once. Remember the sites control their resources, OSG doesn't.

It attempts to be grid-agnostic and can be used by multiple grids.  Read more...  What is the OSG Software Stack? How is it related to the VDT?  The OSG Software Stack is the subset of the VDT used by OSG sites. It also includes OSG-specific configuration such as hostnames of services running in OSG.  What is Pacman?  Pacman  is the package management tool that was used to install most of the OSG software stack prior to Release3. We now use yum and RPMs. See  yum and RPM basics .  Why do you use Pacman instead of RPM?  Pacman provides some really nice features, such as the ability to install multiple versions at the same time and the ability to install software as non-root. That said, as of the writing of this answer (February 2010), we are working hard on providing the VDT as native packages, both RPM and Debian.     How is the OSG software validated before moving a new release to production?  All OSG software undergoes three levels of testing before releasing it to production. First, the VDT team tests software internally. Second, a small group of sites called the Validation Testbed (or VTB) tests the software. Finally, a larger group of cooperative sites called the Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed (or ITB) do testing along with VOs, who ensure their software continues to work correctly. Only once the ITB has given its stamp of approval can we release the software for production use.",

OSG welcomes new resources! The basic installation of an OSG Compute Element or Storage Element requires that certain sets of hardware be available and configured with the OSG software. You will also need to determine your site's policies for usage. It is best to contact us (see  contacts  or you can dive into the  documentation .      What should I name my OSG resource?  Each OSG resource needs a unique name by which services and resources may refer to the resource. This name will be displayed on the Site Catalog and used in tables for other monitoring and accounting. See  Resource Name .  How do I install an OSG compute element?  The OSG Computer Element (CE) software has several prerequisites for the platform and hardware. You will also need to understand the systems that you will be using for your CE and worker nodes, along with the network and firewall configuration for your site.

If you believe a security incident has occurred with an OSG resource, please go to  Incident Discovery and Reporting , and report it  immediately .          After a security incident, how do I (as a resource admin) ban a suspicious user?    Currently, OSG software stack does not provide any banning tool. The security team is working to provide a banning tool this year. However, there are a few effective alternatives.  First, if the suspicious user's certificate is revoked (this quite often happens in incidents), make sure that you have updated CRL lists from that CA. You can manually download the CRLs or run fetch-crl script provided by VDT. This is already installed in your VDT stack and typically under your installation directory. Once downloaded the CRLs will most likely be located in /etc/grid-security/certificates. This will ensure that at the authentication step, the suspicious user would fail and cannot access your grid resources. Of course, you have to ensure that your applications and resources/services also consult the CRLs during the authentication step.  If the certificate is not revoked, you can remove the mapping for this user in your GUMS (see GUMS web page  https://www.racf.bnl.gov/Facility/GUMS/1.2/use_configuration.html ). Once the user's mapping is removed, the user's authorization with your site would fail. However, be careful that every 8 hours or so, your GUMS server synchronizes with VOMS servers. Therefore if the suspicious user is still listed as a member of a VO, your GUMS server would fetch the membership and create a mapping for this user. You can either remove the user's mapping every 8 hours from GUMS or create a special \"null\" mapping for the user in your GUMS. This null mapping should not be overwritten by the synchronization data.  What is a grid certificate?  Grid certificates are ways to prove that you are who you claim to be when you attempt to use an OSG resource. These certificates are issued by a trusted source (e.g., the US Dept. of Energy) and require a password from you. In this way, they are similar to using ID cards such as your driver's license or passport. You must have a currently valid certificate that was issued from an approved Certificate Authority to use OSG resources.  Read more...       How do I get or renew a grid certificate for users of the OSG?  There is  How do I get a certificate for the OSG . Contact your Virtual Organization for what certificate authority is used within your group. To renew an unexpired certificate or replace an expired certificate, see  miscellaneous certificate tasks .      Can someone reset the password on my certificate key?  No. You are the only person who knows the password to your keys.     What are OSG users' responsibilities in keeping OSG resources secure?  As an OSG user, you are expected to:\n    * Protect your grid identity token\n    * Abide by the policies and procedures of your Virtual Organization (VO)\n    * Report any known or suspected security breach Read more...       What are OSG resource administrators' and VO administrators' responsibilities in keeping OSG secure?    As an admin, you are expected to:\n    * Protect all grid identity tokens (personal, host, service)\n    * Follow the  instructions for installing and configuring OSG software \n    * Abide by the policies and procedures of your Virtual Organization (VO)\n    * Report any known or suspected security breach Read more...       What do I do if my root certificate expires?  You can fetch the new certificate, if available and import it into your trusted root CA directories. Please make sure that that you download the Digicert root and intermediate CA certs that are needed to add to the OS X Keychain (for example) or to the trusted issuer stores in the various browsers from  here . See  Install CA certificates in the browser  for the entire procedure.  If there is no new certificate, then you can remove the expired certificate from trusted CA directory. Since the CA is no longer serving, you do not trust the certificates issued by this CA.  How do I update my GUMS service template?  This is discussed in  Installing and Configuring GUMS . You will use the  gums-create-config  script.      How do I update my CA trusted directories?  There is a package to automatically update the trusted CA certificates begining with VDT 1.8 (OSG 0.8). See http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html#vdt-update-certs  My web browser does not trust the OSG CA?

Risk is a function of threat and vulnerability. R(Threat, Vulnerability). A threat that has no existing vulnerability at OSG does not constitute a risk; a vulnerability without any existing threat does not constitute a risk.\n\n\nA system with no risks can only happen when it is entirely isolated from the outside world and under tight security controls. OSG's goal is not to create a \"perfect\" system but prevent unacceptable risks. The impact of a risk is proportional to the loss caused by the risk. A risk with very small likelihood and very large loss potential has a higher impact than a risk with higher likelihood but a much smaller loss. OSG risk assessment evaluates the risks to OSG core services/assets and classifies their impacts.\n\n\nFor example, an acceptable risk with LOW impact: A security event has LOW risk if it occurs less than 10 times per year AND does not disrupt the perception of the OSG as a reliable computational facility AND no single occurrence of the event disables substantially all of OSG\u2019s operational Compute Element service for more than two days.\u201d\n\n\nThe OSG security plan describes the security controls (activities, audits, checks, etc) that should be followed to minimize the risks. It includes management (policies, roles and responsibilitites), operational (how people should behave) and technical (how service/machine should behave) controls.\n\n\nThe OSG Security Officer is responsible for coordinating, monitoring, responding to, and supporting the security of the OSG infrastructure.

A VO, site or support center has their own security officers and are responsible for providing their own security. For example, each VO and site is expected to have their security policies stated and implemented. OSG does not develop policies or implement them on its member's behalf. The OSG security team helps OSG members by providing examples, templates, services and tools; however, the ultimate responsibility lies with the member entity to ensure its security.\n\n\nEach VO and site is accountable for its actions in the OSG. They are expected to follow and comply with the OSG policies. A VO is responsible for the behavior of its members. OSG provides access to users due to their membership with a VO and OSG's trust in that VO. When users violates OSG policies, OSG holds the corrsponding VO responsible and may even bar that VO from OSG membership. therefore, it is a VO's responsibility to ensure that their users understand VO and OSG policies when they join the VO.\n\n\nLikewise, a site is responsible for its resources and services provided to the OSG community. For example, security hygiene of the resources, the due diligence to apply security patches, and cooperating during a security incident are among the site responsibilities. A site not meeting their responsibilities may be barred from OSG membership.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, OSG expects each of its members to comply with the OSG policies and agreements and show due diligence to follow their own security policies.

The OSG security team monitors and reviews the asset protection (including services and software stack), audits the asset owners, prepares and maintains policies, and maintains operational security. For example, OSG infrastructure (the software stack) is reviewed against vulnerabilities and additional patches or improvements are requested by the security team; the configuration of OSG services are audited by the security team yearly and adjustments are requested.\n\n\nIn order to help OSG members, the security team provides security education, template policies and tools.

Protecting your grid identity means protecting your private key so that no one else is able to use (or misuse) it. Typically the private key is stored in a file called $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem. The (public) certificate needs to be accessible to parties and resources to which you'll need to authenticate yourself. It is typically stored in a file called $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem.\n\n\nTo protect your private key, please follow these security guidelines with respect to your \nuserkey.pem\n file:\n\n\n\n\nCopy \nuserkey.pem\n to and/or store it only in a file that is accessible to yourself alone, i.e., to which no one else has privileges.

This has been mentioned multiple times on our other OSG security pages, but it is still one of the best ways to protect your systems from compromise.\n\n\nResources:\n\n\n\n\nUpdate between minor OSG revisions\n\n\nUpdating between minor OSG releases has been drastically improved\n\n\nPlease promptly install the latest OSG update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVDT Update Information\n\n\nRed Hat Network\n: Automates updates for Red Hat Linux systems.\n\n\n\n\nSecuring Services on Grid Machines\n\n\nAll of your grid nodes should be configured with the best practice guideline of not running any services on the machine which are not needed. So if local SSH access is not needed on your CE's then do not enable GSI-SSH. Another good stance to take is don't implicitly trust your local users. So patching against local vulnerabilities can be just as important as patching against remote vulnerabilities. You cannot protect against a remote users desktop getting compromised and then being used as an attack against your systems. Lastly, even if users do not have interactive login access to your machines they can still run pretty much anything they want with submitting jobs. So keep your machines patched and running with the minimal services needed.\n\n\nSecurity for Application Administrators\n\n\nVO Application Administrators are expected to:\n\n\n\n\n(\nat a bare minimum\n) Ensure that their software does not compromise the security of any site upon which it runs;\n\n\nEnsure that the software installation procedures follow all posted OSG security policies and procedures (see the \nOSG security pages\n for more details);\n\n\nEnsure that the software installation procedures follow all posted site-specific security policies and procedures for those sites where the software is installed and run (see each site's entry on \nMyOSG\n);\n\n\nEnsure that their software and the installation and execution thereof is consistent with the VO's own posted policies, procedures and purpose (which should be posted and up to date on \nMyOSG\n);\n\n\nPromptly follow the \nincident reporting procedures\n in the event that a security problem is discovered.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Handling\n\n\nPromptly report security incidents involving OSG resources according to \nthese instructions\n.\n\n\nResources:\n\n\n\n\nBanning User DNs at your site\n\n\nBasic Forensics Techniques\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring\n\n\nMonitor for suspicious activity such as\n\n\n\n\nconnection attempts from suspicious IP addresses\n\n\ninstances of suspicious ssh keys, files, and malware\n\n\n\n\nRecommended monitoring tools:\n\n\n\n\nLogwatch\n: A customizable log analysis system.\n\n\nSamhain\n: A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS).\n\n\nBro\n: A network intrusion detection system (NIDS).\n\n\nchkrootkit\n: A tool to locally check for signs of a rootkit.\n\n\n\n\nFirewalls and Blocking Hosts\n\n\nUse firewalls to restrict access to system services:\n\n\n\n\nAllow ssh connections (port 22) only from trusted hosts. See \nSshHostsAllow\n for documentation on how to restrict access using \n/etc/hosts.allow\n and \n/etc/hosts.deny\n.\n\n\n\n\nFirewall resources:\n\n\n\n\nVDT and Firewalls\n - lists all ports used with VDT software.\n\n\niptables\n: The command-line program for configuring the Linux firewall.\n\n\n\n\nAnother option for blocking hosts is using the \nDenyHosts package\n. This package can help protect against the constant SSH brute force attacks. It will watch the system logs and detect when a brute force attack is occurring and then block the offending host in real time. There are many other nice features that \nDenyHosts\n also provides.\n\n\nMapping Grid DN's to Local Accounts\n\n\nAt some point sites are going to need to decide on how to map users grid DN's to local accounts. Traditionally OSG has not mandated to sites how they need to map accounts, this has been delegated to the VO's. There are a couple models that VO's have used, and we'll touch on the security implications for each of these methods.\n\n\nMapping DN's to a local VO account (group account)\n\n\nThis is one of the easiest ways to enable users within VO's to run jobs at your site. You only need to create one local user for each VO you are going to allow access, then each of the individual user's DN's within that VO will map to that local account. Though this may be the easiest to configure, it may be one of the less secure methods. Since all users are mapped to the same local account, that account is acting like a group account. When a problem may occur it could lead to difficulty in tracking down which user in the VO may have caused the problem. Also, since it is a group account all users will have access to any source or data files that are in that local accounts directory. Some users may clean up after themselves when a job is finished, but others may not. There may be VO's with a small number of users, who happen to share all their data and code, where this method would work great. Still, many of the VO's do choose to use this method. The risk of this method is primarily risk to the VO, and not the local site since all the the VO's users will be sharing the same account.\n\n\nMapping DN's to a static pool of accounts\n\n\nWith this method a pool of accounts is created for each VO where the number of accounts will be equal to the number of users in each VO. Then each unique DN is mapped to a unique account within the VO pool. This is the most secure method of mapping DN's to local accounts. In this case no user should ever be able to see another users source or data files, as well as having a straightforward auditing capability to track problems with a local account to the specific user. There are some additional administration items to cover in this method (such as needing to create potentially hundreds or thousands of local accounts for a VO), but the benefits of this usually outweigh the overhead.\n\n\nMapping all DN's (in all VO's) to one account\n\n\nThis method is NOT a supported configuration within OSG. If it is discovered that a site has mapped all DN's in all VO's to one account then we will work with them on modifying their configuration to one of the above valid options. The security implications of this is hopefully obvious to most admins where any data, source code, etc. will be accessible to all users in any VO.\n\n\nSSH Keys\n\n\nProtect SSH private keys with passphrases. There have been recent attacks at grid sites where miscreants are stealing users ssh keys, searching for keys without pass phrases, and then using those to attack other sites.\n\n\nAlso don't share keys. Your account is your own (and you are responsible for it).\n\n\nSimple ways to monitor your systems for SSH activity (Look at Monitoring Ssh Activity)\n\n\nAccount Passwords\n\n\nThere has been a ton of research into the use and security of passwords. But a few of the most basic security practices for passwords are:\n\n\nUse different passwords for different accounts. Sharing passwords across different accounts may seem to make it easier, but it can also be more damaging if one of the many accounts gets compromised.\n\n\nAlways use good passwords. It is good practice to use different character classes in passwords (upper, lower, numerical, special characters, etc.). Also, pass phrases are becoming very popular to user rather than passwords. So instead of using an 8 character password, you can use a much longer pass phrase (which may even be easier to remember), such as something like \"B3tter0ffDead\" (3 different character classes and 13 characters long). But don't use that one...\n\n\nSecurity Considerations when using GUMS\n\n\nThere is a section in the \nGUMS online documentation\n that addresses the \nsecurity considerations to take when running a GUMS server\n.\n\n\nHands-on Training\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Training (from OSG All Hands Meeting)\n\n\n\n\nReference Materials\n\n\n\n\nA How-To Guide for Basic Linux Security\n\n\nO Reilly - Practical UNIX \n Internet Security",

You only need to create one local user for each VO you are going to allow access, then each of the individual user's DN's within that VO will map to that local account. Though this may be the easiest to configure, it may be one of the less secure methods. Since all users are mapped to the same local account, that account is acting like a group account. When a problem may occur it could lead to difficulty in tracking down which user in the VO may have caused the problem. Also, since it is a group account all users will have access to any source or data files that are in that local accounts directory. Some users may clean up after themselves when a job is finished, but others may not. There may be VO's with a small number of users, who happen to share all their data and code, where this method would work great. Still, many of the VO's do choose to use this method. The risk of this method is primarily risk to the VO, and not the local site since all the the VO's users will be sharing the same account.",

Sharing passwords across different accounts may seem to make it easier, but it can also be more damaging if one of the many accounts gets compromised.  Always use good passwords. It is good practice to use different character classes in passwords (upper, lower, numerical, special characters, etc.). Also, pass phrases are becoming very popular to user rather than passwords. So instead of using an 8 character password, you can use a much longer pass phrase (which may even be easier to remember), such as something like \"B3tter0ffDead\" (3 different character classes and 13 characters long).
