# OSG-SEC-2019-11-15 Vulnerability in Squid UPDATE 2

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

## UPDATE 2:
This is an update to OSG-SEC-2019-11-11[1].

OSG 3.5.5[2] and 3.4.39[3] have been released containing frontier-squid-4.9-2.1, fixing the two high-priority vulnerabilities described in the original announcement. 

OSG Security recommends updating to frontier-squid-4.9-2.1 as soon as possible. The previously described workaround involving /etc/squid/customize.sh is no longer necessary when running frontier-squid-4.9-21.
