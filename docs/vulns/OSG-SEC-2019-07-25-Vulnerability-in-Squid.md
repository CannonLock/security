# OSG-SEC-2019-07-25 Vulnerability in Squid

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

The frontier-squid package has a publicly announced security vulnerability that can potentially enable remote code execution from any IP address that access control allows to use the squid.  All sites that have frontier-squid-4.* versions should upgrade urgently, especially those that have squids that can be used from the internet.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

frontier-squid-4.* 

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

Due to incorrect buffer management, squid is vulnerable to a heap overflow and possible remote code execution attack when processing HTTP Authentication credentials. This happens when squid is asked to proxy ftp, which it allows by default.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

If you have frontier-squid-4.* installed, upgrade to a version where the vulnerability is removed.  OSG has released frontier-squid-4.4-2.1 which only adds a patch for this problem to version 4.4-1.1. Upstream had previously released 4.6 versions which are also vulnerable. The upstream frontier-squid-4.8-1.1 version fixes this problem in addition to including other features and bug fixes. So upgrade to either version OSG frontier-squid-4.4-2.1 or upstream 4.8-1.1.
