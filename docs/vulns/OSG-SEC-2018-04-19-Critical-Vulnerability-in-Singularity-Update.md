# OSG-SEC-2018-04-19 [FOLLOW-UP] Critical Vulnerability in Singularity

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

This is a follow-up to the previously announced Critical vulnerability in singularity. OSG has released a new version singularity-2.4.6 that eliminates the vulnerability.  Note that for the security fix the new version puts a restriction on combinations of options that do bind mounts, and this is known to currently cause CMS jobs to fail.  CMS was notified but hasnâ€™t yet had the resources to change their production pilot scripts, so CMS sites will probably want to wait to do the upgrade until they get a go-ahead from CMS.  Sites that do not upgrade are encouraged to keep the previously announced mitigation in effect until they do upgrade.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:
All singularity versions from 2.2.1 and later on RHEL7 and its derivatives are affected.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- Upgrade to singularity-2.4.6 or leave the 'enable overlay = no' mitigation in place.  
- When you upgrade, watch for /etc/singularity/singularity.conf.rpmnew and clean it up.
