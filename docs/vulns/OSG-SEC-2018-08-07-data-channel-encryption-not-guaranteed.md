# OSG-SEC-2018-08-07 data-channel encryption not guaranteed

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

This advisory is intended for VO contacts. 

If you need encrypted data transfer, encrypt the data before transmission instead of using GridFTP's built-in data encryption. This is because data-channel encryption is not necessarily guaranteed, even when requested.

Please contact the OSG security team at security@opensciencegrid.org if you have any questions or concerns.
