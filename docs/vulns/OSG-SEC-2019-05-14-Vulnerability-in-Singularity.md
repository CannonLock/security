# OSG-SEC-2019-05-14 Vulnerability in Singularity

Dear OSG users,
 
Impacted:  Singularity 3.x.x, all versions
Severity:   High

The OSG Security Team wants to inform you that a high severity vulnerability has been announced for privileged installations of all Singularity 3.x.x versions.  A new version with a fix to the vulnerability is being prepared by OSG.  The current primary Singularity version supported by OSG, version 2.6.1, is not vulnerable.  OSG does however support a 3.x.x version in the osg-upcoming yum repository and some sites have installed it.

We will send a follow up announcement when a new version is available, but meanwhile there is a mitigation, below.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
If you are using privileged Singularity 3.x.x on a RHEL7-based distribution, while waiting for the new version either downgrade to version 2.6.1 or enable unprivileged Singularity [1] and set 

```
    allow setuid = no
```

in singularity.conf.  

If you are using Singularity 3.x.x on a RHEL6-based distribution, downgrade to version 2.6.1.

## HOW IT WORKS:
A malicious user with local/network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability due to insecure permissions allowing a user to edit files within /run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>. The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host [2] [3].
