# OSG Security

Welcome to OSG Security

The OSG security team's goal is to provide a security framework that enables science and promotes autonomous and open science collaboration among Virtual Organizations (VOs), sites, and software providers. Keeping the balance between the openness, which is necessary for science, and the security is at the core of our work. 

Our mission is to protect OSG users and resources from security breaches and provide convenient access to OSG resources.
